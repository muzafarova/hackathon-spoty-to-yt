# Spotify &rarr; YouTube automation
A hackathon project.

This project is powered by an [automation cloud](https://automationcloud.net/download) script that takes your Spotify playlist (or album) and finds the songs on YouTube.
The end goal was to re-create the list of songs on the YouTube, but we hit the wall and run of time :D 

## Where to get a playlist/or album URL 

Open your playlist in Spotify 
  * click on "..." 
  * click on "Share"
  * click on "Copy Playlist link"

## Development

Use Vercel CLI to run the project locally https://vercel.com/download

`npm i && npm start`
